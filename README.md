# Eid-Sales-Analysis

### Hi, I'm Esha! ðŸ‘‹ , Here are some details of the project:


### Project Overview
This Eid Sales Data Analysis aims to provide the insights of the sales of the company. By analysing the various aspects of the sales data we seek to identify trends, and can gain deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is "Eid Sales Data.csv" ,containing all the important information of the company sales. I have also added that file in this repository.

### Tools
- Jupiter Notebook [Dowload here](https://jupyter.org/)

### Data Cleaning 
- Data loading and inspection
- Removing all null values in the dataset
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions , such as:
1. Most of the customers are male or female?
2. Age group of the customers?
3. What are the total sales rom top 10 states?
4. What are the marital status and occupation of the customers?
5. Which is the most selling product ?

### Results / Findings
Married Women age group 26-35 years from UP, Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are most likely to buy products from Food, Cloting and Electronic category.

### Limitations
I had to remove all the null values, because they can effect the analysis.
